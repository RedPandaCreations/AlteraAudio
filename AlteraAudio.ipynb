        "AlteraAudio is a program written in the Python programming language designed to seamlessly download YouTube videos and audio. It simplifies the download process, eliminating the need for complex setups or external tools. In addition to offering a user-friendly interface with non-programmer users in mind, AlteraAudio also has a key advantage over other downloaders: the ability to preserve metadata. If the user elects to download a song, this functionality ensures that downloaded audio files retain crucial information such as artist name, song title, and album name. AlteraAudio is built on Google Colab, a cloud-based computing platform that allows you to run code in your browser without downloading or installing anything. Now that you're familiar with AlteraAudio's capabilities, let's delve into the setup process in the next cell."

        "- `m4a` is an audio format that is lossless but isn't universally recognized\n",
        "- `mp4` is a video format rather than an audio file. No metadata will be attached to video files\n",

        "### Download\n",
        "\n",
        "The `Download` checkmark allows you to decide whether or not to automatically download the output to your device.

        "### It says I need to sign in\n",

        "You need a Google account to use Colab. If you don't have one, make one, and if you do have one, use it to sign in.\n",
        "\n",
        "### It's not letting me connect to a runtime\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to run scripts (like AlteraAudio), Colab connects to one of Google's computers and makes *it* do the processing. If there isn't a computer available, Colab will say it isn't able to connect. There isn't an easy way to fix this, so you'll just have to wait for a spot to open up.\n",
        "\n",
        "### How do I know what the URL of my video is?\n",
        "\n",
        "Go to YouTube, navigate to your video, and select 'Share'. Then select 'Copy Link'. Back in AlteraAudio, paste the link into the 'URL' field.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you can't access the YouTube website, I made another notebook to get around that: [SatelliteSearch](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WjWwWbYvqxCabLJNQuD2ldPG2HqrlgWw#scrollTo=a3BQttF0xcsM).\n",
        "\n",
        "### I'm not seeing the cover art\n",
        "\n",
        "If you can't see the cover art after downloading the file, it could be an error with AlteraAudio, but it's far more likely to be your media player. Windows Media Player in particular has a penchant for not reading metadata. There isn't really a way to fix it other than installing a [better media player](https://getmusicbee.com/). (Note, if you've figured out a way to fix this, please [get in touch](mailto:29sr494d5@mozmail.com?subject=AlteraAudio%20Support) so I can implement it)\n",

        "\n",
        "AlteraAudio can't get YouTube Music album covers. The code library I use doesn't have the capability. In most cases, the cover art of each song is the same as the album cover, although plenty of YouTube channels ignore this guideline. There's no way to fix this other than manually editing the cover art. To do this, see the below section about metadata editing.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Changing the Metadata\n",
        "\n",
        "AlteraAudio isn't a metadata editing software. If you want to (for example) change the album art to something else, you can do so with a dedicated metadata editor.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Many modern media players (including Windows Media Player) come included with a metadata editor, so you could always just use those.\n",
        " - You could also get a third party editor, such as an [online website](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/) or a [dedicated application](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NN77TCQ1NC8?ocid=pdpshare)\n",
        " - If there's a demand for it, I might make a metadata editor in Colab. I don't plan on it (I usually make things primarily for my own personal use, and I'm content with the metadata editor in [the media player I use](https://getmusicbee.com/)), but if that's something you'd want me to make, feel free to [get in touch](mailto:29sr494d5@mozmail.com?subject=AlteraAudio%20Support).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Slow Downloads\n",
        "\n",
        "There are a few reasons that could cause slow downloads. Here are a few:\n",
        "\n",
        " - Large video size. The longer the video is in length, the longer AlteraAudio will take to download it. To see if this is the problem, try again with the example song. The example song usually takes about 12 seconds to process in audio mode. As long as it takes less than, say, 20 seconds, the size of the selected video probably isn't causing the problem.\n",
        " - Slow internet speed. AlteraAudio uses the internet to download files from YouTube's servers to your device. To increase connection speeds, move your device closer to your router or connect to a different network.\n",
        " - Google server overload. It's possible that an unusal number of people are using YouTube or Colab, meaning that Google's servers will take longer to process your request. This scenario is unlikely, but there's really nothing you can do if it happens other than to try again later.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "AlteraAudio is limited to 720p. The library AlteraAudio uses, PyTube, is limited to 720p, so if you want to download videos at a higher resolution, I made another notebook called [DeltaDownload](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1J0ISLEfYjbUVZrSs_1oTYuvi4HzYdzzc) that uses a different library.\n",

        "\n",
        "If AlteraAudio ever outputs an error, it means something has gone wrong. Here are some things you can try.\n",
        "\n",
        " - Make sure you've run the `Setup` block. Without it, AlteraAudio *cannot run*.\n",
        " - Try again with a different video. It's possible that AlteraAudio can't process that video, or the URL is invalid. To see if this is the case, see if it still works with a different video.\n",
        " - Restart the Colab runtime. Common advice for any computer problem is to turn it off and back on again. The equivalent in Colab is going to `Runtime` at the top and selecting 'Disconnect and delete runtime'. This will restart everything, so you'll need to rerun the `Setup` block.\n",
        " - If you've tried all of these and it still doesn't work, YouTube probably changed something, breaking PyTube. Please [email me](mailto:29sr494d5@mozmail.com?subject=AlteraAudio%20Support) with your error so I can fix it."
